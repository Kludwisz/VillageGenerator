# VillageGenerator
Simulate the generation of villages in minecraft
For now only 3 types of villages are working : DESERT, TAIGA AND PLAIN.

I used Kaptain Wutax librairies and mojang code.

Credit to Mojang and Kaptain Wutax and Neil for their librairies. I reused the start of their VillageGenerator.
