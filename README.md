# VillageGenerator
Simulate the generation of villages in minecraft
For now only 3 types of villages are working : DESERT, TAIGA AND PLAIN.
It's working for 1.16 only right now.
Currently working on SAVANNA and SNOWY village
I used Kaptain Wutax librairies and mojang code. 

Credit to Mojang and Kaptain Wutax and Neil for their librairies. I reused the start of their VillageGenerator.
